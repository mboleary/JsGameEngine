# JsGameEngine

This is a modular Game Engine built for the Browser. It utilizes modules to add the features required for the game, and nothing more.

This engine, and the core modules still require more work before they should be considered stable enough to use in production.

## Modules

- Input: This handles managing user input from the Keyboard, and Gamepads.
- Physics: Handles collision detection
- Puppeteer: Syncs GameObject state between players connected to a Websocket Server
- Render: Draws the GameObjects to the page

## Other Notable Parts
- Asset Loader: Manages loading Assets in Groups, or individually
- Spritesheet: Class used to manage pulling images from a spritesheet

## Demo, Included Assets
This repo includes assets from an old demo game I made many years ago
